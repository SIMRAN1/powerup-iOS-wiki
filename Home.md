## PowerUp - Overview  

PowerUp seeks to empower pre-adolescents to take charge of their reproductive health through a choose-your-own-adventure mobile game that teaches social emotional learning, conflict resolution, and health skills in a fun, interactive way.   

The game involves various map sites like home, library etc. where the user is required to answer option based questions related to reproductive health. The app includes mini games for which the user are awarded points if answered correctly.  In order to accomplish its goal, the app comprises of various map sites like library, hospital etc. On each of the map sites, several questions are asked in the form of conversations, which are termed as mini games. 

#### Sample conversations
Rosie BF: Lets party at your place tonight.   
Rosie: A) I am down       B) I don't think so

## Goals and Objectives

#### Goals
* Equip pre-adolescent girls in the “pre-contemplation” stage who are not aware that they may be at risk and have no intention to change their sexual behaviors to become aware of issues concerning puberty and reproductive health.
* Draw attention towards several issues during adolescent period and provide solutions to the same.

#### Objectives
* Create a mobile application with a game platform that supports simulated situations about sex and puberty and advocate development of self-esteem and critical thinking.
* Offer games and activities to help visualize related concepts through self-directed interactions in a low-stress environment

## Game Content and Mechanics 
#### Curriculum:
* The game content is based on SEL Core Competencies i.e Self-awareness, Self-management, Social awareness, Relationship Skills and Decision Making . 
* Popular media is used in the storyline, music and avatar accessories.

#### Points:
* Points are earned through decision making, based on users’ ability to think critically, demonstrate self-esteem, and understanding of reproductive health.
* Points can be used to purchase clothes, accessories, and advancing in levels.
* To promote positive reinforcements, points can not be removed due to what 
might be considered “poor decision making” 

#### Superpowers:
* As the character evolves and gains points in the game, she will also gather superhero powers associated with particular personality traits that will be added to the main character's slate of options as she faces new situations.

#### Mini Games: 
* Mini games will be integrated indirectly to indirect address key information surrounding reproductive health.

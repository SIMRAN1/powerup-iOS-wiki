## Mission
Systers is an international community for all women involved in the technical aspects of computing. We welcome the participation of women technologists of all ages and at any stage of their studies or careers.  

We engage our community by contributing to open source, collaborating with the global community, and learning/enhancing our coding skills.  We are committed to providing a safe, positive online community for our many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to our projects.

In order to engage with the community, you can sign up on [Systers Open Source Slack](http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/).

## Code of Conduct
A primary goal of Systers is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

## What is PowerUp?

PowerUp seeks to empower pre-adolescents to take charge of their reproductive health through a choose-your-own-adventure mobile game that teaches social emotional learning, conflict resolution, and health skills in a fun, interactive way.

## What are the goals and objectives of PowerUp?

Equip preadolescent girls with awareness and knowledge about issues concerning puberty and reproductive health
Create a virtual environment by offering games and activities that would help visualize related concepts through self-directed	interactions in a low-stress environment 
Support preadolescent girls in their development of self empowerment
Advocate development of self esteem and critical thinking through a gaming platform

## Project Design
### Curriculum

The game content is based on SEL Core Competencies (Self-awareness, Self- management, Social awareness, Relationship skills, Decision making).

### Points
Points will be awarded throughout the storyline 	and minigames to encourage right decisions. They are assigned based on usersâ€™ ability to think critically, demonstrate self-esteem, and understanding of reproductive health. Points can be further used for purchasing new clothes/accessories or advancing to new levels.

### Evolving Character 
The Avatar,starting at age 13, would evolve to emulate corresponding storylines regarding puberty, aging, and self-esteem. 

### Superpowers
Superpowers associated with particular personality traits of the Avatar can be gained as and when new scenarios/challenges are presented before the Avatar. These superpowers would manifest in playful forms of positive attributes.

### Mini Games 			
Spread throughout the game to tackle situations/topics in an indirect but playful manner. Giving a break from the main storyline, they would be associated with a timer and other features.

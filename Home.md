#Welcome to the PowerUp-iOS wiki!

##What is PowerUp?

PowerUp seeks to empower pre-adolescents to take charge of their reproductive health through a choose-your-own-adventure mobile game that teaches social emotional learning, conflict resolution, and health skills in a fun, interactive way.

##What are the goals and objectives of PowerUp?

Equip preadolescent girls with awareness and knowledge about issues concerning puberty and reproductive health
Create a virtual environment by offering games and activities that would help visualize related concepts through self-directed	interactions in a low-stress environment 
Support preadolescent girls in their development of self empowerment
Advocate development of self esteem and critical thinking through a gaming platform

##Project Design
###Curriculum

The game content is based on SEL Core Competencies (Self-awareness, Self- management, Social awareness, Relationship skills, Decision making).

###Points
Points will be awarded throughout the storyline 	and minigames to encourage right decisions. They are assigned based on usersâ€™ ability to think critically, demonstrate self-esteem, and understanding of reproductive health. Points can be further used for purchasing new clothes/accessories or advancing to new levels.

###Evolving Character 
The Avatar,starting at age 13, would evolve to emulate corresponding storylines regarding puberty, aging, and self-esteem. 

###Superpowers
Superpowers associated with particular personality traits of the Avatar can be gained as and when new scenarios/challenges are presented before the Avatar. These superpowers would manifest in playful forms of positive attributes.

###Mini Games 			
Spread throughout the game to tackle situations/topics in an indirect but playful manner. Giving a break from the main storyline, they would be associated with a timer and other features.

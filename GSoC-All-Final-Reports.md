# Sanya Jain 2016
### Overview:
PowerUp seeks to empower pre-adolescents to take charge of their reproductive health through a choose-your-own-adventure mobile game that teaches social emotional learning, conflict resolution and health skills in a fun, interactive way. The app aims to advocate development of self-esteem and critical thinking among young girls and support them in the process of self-empowerment. PowerUp-iOS is developed on Xcode IDE using Swift language.

### Accomplishments:
* Implementation of Dressing Room-1 to select facial features,hair and clothes for the Avatar
* Creation of Customised Avatar from the choice of Avatar features
* Implementation of Dressing room-2 to select Avatar accessories,clothes,hairstyles at the end of a scenario
* Assignment of points to Dressing room-2 items
* Added functionality to purchase items from accumulated points and display "Paid" labels
* Implementation of Start and New User Button functionality
* Changes in existing database to store Avatar features for Dressing Rooms implementation

### Challenges:
* Changed the Project name on Github from Database to Powerup. This led to many build errors and many files in the Xcode project had to be altered to resolve the errors.
* Upgraded Xcode to 7.3.1 which supports swift Syntax 2.2. This led to many compile time errors that were fixed by manually changing syntax in many files.         

### Take-Aways:
* The unparalleled experience of collaborating with a diverse team of developers, mentors and admins spread around the globe
* A deeper insight into the stages of software development. I realized the importance of testing and periodic code reviews and feedback from mentors that helped me to refine many features of the app.
* Learned new features of Swift language and acquired new coding skills

### Overall experience:
It was absolutely amazing to work on Powerup, I got an excellent opportunity to develop cool new features for the app. I am proud to be a part of the Systers community. It's a great platform for all of us to come together, leverage each other and help in the continued participation of women in the field of computing. I am glad that by being a Syster, I could contribute to a project that would address the needs of the target population and thus bring a positive change in the society.
Even though GSoC has officially ended, my journey isn't over. I would love to contribute more to this project and help others in whatever capacity I can! And last but not least, a special shout out to my mentors Jennifer Parak and Harshita Kasera who helped me a lot throughout the project by providing periodic code reviews and constructive feedback on different aspects of the game. Thank you so much! :)

# Differences Between iOS and Android

1. There are considerably more avatar customization options when starting the game in Android. The iOS app only has 3 hairstyles and 1 outfit.

5. The iOS version notifies how many karma points have been earned and labels the current scenario at the top of the screen once a scenario has finished. The Android version does not do both of these. Also, choosing the same dialogues results in different karma points being earned (20 for iOS, 8 for Android). The end screen also has no continue button for iOS so the user must replay or go back to the map. There is a continue button for Android which automatically takes the user to the next scenario.
#### iOS scene completion screen does not have a continue button but shows which scenario has been completed and how many karma points (20) have been earned.

6. On the map, the iOS app has a small error in which the school overlaps the smoke coming out of the house's chimney. The Android app does not have this issue.
#### iOS school issue

8. There are different animations for vocab match tile game. In Android, the tile converges with the clip board and the clip board enlarges for a small period of time while the tile just disappears in the iOS version.

9. The iOS end screen for the vocab match game does not show how many were wrong and does not have the same UI as the other minigame end screens.

## PowerUp (iOS) - Systers Project
_**Abstract**- A female empowerment educational app that allows young girls (12 to 14) to learn about reproductive health and self-esteem by navigating the life of their avatar. Through this project, I hope to implement features that would serve as better options for educating preadolescents who are at risk for pregnancy and spread of sexually transmitted infection(STI) due to lack of information about the associated risks and responsibilities._
